- 👋 Hi, I’m @cluelesscoder-999

- 👀 I’m interested in all things IT related. I've been interested in tech since high school when I started taking computer classes. My senior year I built my first gaming computer.
-  I didn't end up pursuing technology as career after that because I didn't know much about the different career avenues that tech had. I thought I wasn't smart enough to find something I could grasp. Now after 8 years I'm trying my hand at it.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, and using Hackthebox for cybersecurity tasks. I'm trying to get as much hands on material as possible before I start trying to tackly certs.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that someone is willing to show me. I would like to start with some simply python scripts as I am very new to it and don't have any projects under my belt just yet.
